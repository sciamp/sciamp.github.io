Hi everybody, my name's [Alessandro Campagni](https://it.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocampagni), my friends call me sciamp though,
I'm a software engineer based in Florence.

After five years spent at the computer engineering school I felt I need to find some
adventure and inspiration.
Mathematics school seemed to be enough challenging, I did go for it and it's been
a hell of a pleasure.

By the way, in spite of my mind feeling so comfortable with highly abstract stuff,
I still work as a software engineer. Of course I like to change very often so
after some web stuff (back in the engineering school days) I did some ruby on rails
(especially on the back end side).
During math school I had the pleasure to be a Google Summer of Code student working
on a free software project with some really cool guys at the GNOME Foundation.
Then some Android, then again a little more ruby back end with some Ember.js for
the front end while I was working at Phoops s.r.l.
After that Java was next in line! So I worked with the awesome Spring Framework
for everything concerning the back end and Vaadin for the front end. In the meanwhile
I had to deal with Jasper reports, Liferay and the business process management platform
Activiti.
Right now I'm working as a system integration consultant for GE Oil & Gas.
