It's been a long time since my last post (now disabled due to some
issues with importation in octopress, sorry!). Well I was a little busy: last
exams, my
[bachelor degree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0iYfsAyvA)
([Edoardo](http://www.lenotta.com/) thanks for the excellent video!), and of course some warm up before applying
for the
[Google Summer of Code 2013](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).

<!-- More -->

The goal of the summer of code is a presenter view in
[GNOME Documents](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeDocuments)/[Evince](http://projects.gnome.org/evince/)
with some goodies to enhance the quality of the presentation, maybe
this poor picture is worth (more than) a thousand words:

My mentor is [Cosimo Cecchi](http://blogs.gnome.org/cosimoc/).

I'm afraid I'm not so fluent to tell you how much I'm thrilled about
this GSoC thing :D

I believe it's a very big opportunity to learn a thing or two (I heard
my mentor is pretty skilled!) and, to me, this is much more than the
(nice and of course appreciated) paycheck!

More informations are (or will be :P) available at the project page on
[gnome.org](https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2013/Projects/AlessandroCampagni_DualScreen).
I will start coding on June 17th and I will blog about it every two
week.

That's all for now!
