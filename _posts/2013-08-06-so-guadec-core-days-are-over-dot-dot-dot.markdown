 and I'd like to share with you my feelings. I've been to three or four other
conferences in my life and I think GUADEC is quite different, of
course in a better way :)

First of all it is a very friendly environment, I mean before coming
here I knew nobody but my mentor, but after a couple of days (and of
course some cool Czech beers!) I'm talking to many people like I have
known them for a long time! This is cool!

Every talk I attended was very interesting, I especially enjoyed "The
future of GNOME 3" by Allan Day, "Rich custom user interfaces with
Glade and CSS" by Juan Pablo Ugarte, "More secure with less security"
by Stef Walter, "Prototyping in the 4th dimension" by Jakub Steiner
and of course the very inspiring keynote by Matt Dalio.

![Brno](/images/brno.jpg) Some days ago I got a mail from GSoC
staff: I succeeded my midterm evaluation, yay! I received some
positive feedback about my work after the lightning talk, so now it's
time to work hard!

Stay tuned!
