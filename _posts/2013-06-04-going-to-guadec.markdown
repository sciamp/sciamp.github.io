[GUADEC](https://www.guadec.org/) is the annual conference held in
Europe about the development of the GNOME desktop environment.

Some days ago I applyied for a sponsorship and yesterday night I
received a communication from the GNOME travel committee...

<!-- More -->

{% include left_img.html src="/images/gnome_sponsored_badge.png" alt="GNOME badge" %} Yeah, this green fancy
badge means that the GNOME Foundation is going to pay for my flight
and my staying in [Brno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno)! Wow,
this is a real boost to bond with the community and to take part in
the ``GNOME life".

I must confess, yesterday I was so excited I hardly could get to
sleep! I think I have great expectations for GUADEC, I believe I will
love to spend some time with people sharing the same passion for the
free software, for GNOME, for helping each others.

Again, thanks for this opportunity!

I will blog again about this on July 31st while on the road to Brno.

Stay tuned!
